            Physical address where the Kernel and drivers data (including BSS) will be stored in RAM.
            If the kernel is meant to be executed from RAM, this value must be checked to avoid overlapping with kernel code!

            Address where the ROMDISK image will be placed in flash memory. As flash is mapped at physical address 0x0000,
            this value also represents the physical address of ROMDISK image.

        help
            Address where the kernel/OS will be placed in flash memory. This will be used to calculate the offset between,
            the kernel and the romdisk. For example, if kernel is meant to be flashed at 0x4000 and the romdisk at 0x8000,
            the latter will be at a distance of <romdisk_address> - <kernel_entry> = 0x4000 bytes from the kernel entry.

            Let the kernel be aware that an MMU is present or not. This value must be enabled to have full support for Zeal 8-bit
            Computer target.
            Disable this option to test no-MMU kernel. Video driver will be disabled, standard output will be done through UART.

            Import the TF card driver in the kernel compilation. If this option is enabled, the TF card will be seen
            as a disk by the kernel. NOTE: The TF card must contain an MBR header.

            Import the CompactFlash driver in the kernel compilation. If this option is enabled, the CompactFlash will be seen
            as a disk by the kernel. The address and and the initialization timeout can be configured.
            NOTE: At the moment, only reads are supported and the CompactFlash must be using `rawtable` filesystem.

                On startup, the CompactFlash takes some time to initialize itself, this will slow down the kernel startup time.
                This configuration value decides how long the driver should wait for the card to be ready before giving up and
                ignoring it until the next reset.
