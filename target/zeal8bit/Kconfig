            Physical address where the Kernel and drivers data (including BSS) will be stored in RAM.
            If the kernel is meant to be executed from RAM, this value must be checked to avoid overlapping with kernel code!

            Address where the ROMDISK image will be placed in flash memory. As flash is mapped at physical address 0x0000,
            this value also represents the physical address of ROMDISK image.

            Address where the kernel/OS will be placed in flash memory. This will be used to calculate the offset between,
            the kernel and the romdisk. For example, if kernel is meant to be flashed at 0x4000 and the romdisk at 0x8000,
            the latter will be at a distance of <romdisk_address> - <kernel_entry> = 0x4000 bytes from the kernel entry.

            Import the TF card driver in the kernel compilation. If this option is enabled, the TF card will be seen

                On startup, the CompactFlash takes some time to initialize itself, this will slow down the kernel startup time.
                This configuration value decides how long the driver should wait for the card to be ready before giving up and
                ignoring it until the next reset.
