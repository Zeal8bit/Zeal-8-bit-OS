# SDCC example for Zeal 8-bit OS

This directory contains an example of how to use and compile the Zeal 8-bit OS kernel C header files provided in `kernel_headers/sdcc`.

## How to compile

In order to compile the example, you will need SDCC v4.2.0 or above. Indeed, the kernel header implementation uses `__sdcccall(1)` calling convention, which is not supported in earlier SDCC versions.
Thus, make sure SDCC is properly installed and up to date in the system.

### Using CMake

Setup the project using:
```
cmake --toolchain $ZOS_PATH/cmake/sdcc_toolchain.cmake -B bin
```

Then compile with:
```
cmake --build bin
```

The output binary will be placed in the `bin/` folder. By default, its name is `main.bin`.

You can change `bin` in the commands above to specify a different output directory.

> When using CMake as a build system, it's possible to have both assembly files and C specified in the `CMakeLists.txt` file to be compiled.

### Using `make` (deprecated)

Then, to compile this example, you will only need the following command:
```
make
```

The output should look like this:
```
mkdir -p bin
sdcc -mz80 -c --codeseg TEXT -I../../sdcc/include/ -o bin/./ src/main.c
sdcc -mz80 -c --codeseg TEXT -I../../sdcc/include/ -o bin/./ src/str.c
sdldz80 -n -mjwx -i -b _HEADER=0x4000 -k /usr/local/share/sdcc/lib/z80 -l z80 bin/example.ihx ../../sdcc/bin/zos_crt0.rel bin/main.rel bin/str.rel
objcopy --input-target=ihex --output-target=binary bin/example.ihx bin/example.bin
Success, binary generated: bin/example.bin
```

As stated on the final line, the binary that can be transferred and executed by Zeal 8-bit OS is `bin/example.bin`.

## How to use

Once loaded in Zeal 8-bit OS, the program will print all the files and directories located in the system current working directory.

If you are familiar with the terminal, this is a cheap equivalent of `ls` command.

## Modifying this example

In order to extend this example, you will need to open and modify the `Makefile`. At first glance, this `Makefile` may seem intimidating but don't panic, its purpose is to be used as a template. In fact, this whole example is meant to be used as a template for you project or program.

In the `Makefile`, modify `SRCS` variable to list all the C files from `src/` folder to be compiled. Because of the way the `Makefile` is done and the limitation of SDCC, only C files can be provided in this variable.

## More details about what Makefile does underneath

To go into more details, there are several limitations in SDCC that make this `Makefile` a bit complex. For example, SDCC doesn't support compiling multiple files at once, in a single command line. Thus, we need to compile each of our files into `rel` (object files) independently and then link them all together.

This is why this example has two files, `main.c` and `str.c`.

Moreover, Zeal 8-bit OS expects all the user programs to start at `0x4000`, so the `crt0`, which is responsible for initializing the global and static variables as well as exiting once `main` returns, must start at `0x4000`. This is not possible without customizing the linker phase. At link time, it is necessary to relocated the `_HEADER` section, which is where the `crt0` is located, and place all the other sections after it.

## "Couldn't find library 'z80'"

If you haven't installed SDCC at the default location, you will need to specify the place where the linker can find the `z80` library provided by SDCC.

To do so, before executing `make`, add the following environment variable:
```
export SDLD_FLAGS="-k <path_to_sdcc_install>/lib/z80"
```

## Cleaning the binaries

Two possibilities to clean the resulted binaries:
* Delete the binary folder:
    ```
    rm -r bin
    ```
* Use make:
    ```
    make clean
    ```
